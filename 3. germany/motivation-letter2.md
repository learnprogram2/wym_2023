As a programmer, I think work culture is crucial. I want to have time to learn and explore work-related knowledge and activities through public communities, as this would greatly benefit my future work capabilities.

I have a quality education background, having obtained a Bachelor's degree in GIS from Tongji University, which is a good university in China. 

About the language, I am proficient in English, which is my working language and I have achieved 7 in IELTS. I am also planning to learn German.
