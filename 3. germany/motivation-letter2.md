Hello, 

My name is Wang Yiming. I am from Shanghai, China where I have been studying and working for nine years. 

I am applying for the  job seeker visa to Germany, and below are my reasons for the application.

**Why I want to go to Germany:**

I desire to work and live in Germany because of its lifestyle and work environment.

In terms of lifestyle, Germany is a relatively open and diverse society. It is known for its immigrant-friendly policies, resulting in a multicultural environment.

I am currently living in Shanghai, which is also known for its openness in China, and I have experienced the benefits of a diversity society. My university was founded by a German and I have some old classmates who are studying and living in Germany, and they all love it. So I want to experience life in Germany as well.

I have a personal interest in history and economics, particularly the differences between Chinese and European. Germany and Europe have a rich history and a rich accumulation of knowledges such as good universities.  I hope to further my interests in a knowledge rish environment.

Moreover, Germany has done well in terms of security in an open society and I like it.

In terms of work, Germany society have a open and vibrant working environment and job opportunities, especially for our software programmer.

Germany's job market offers lots of international job opportunities and has a high demand for software application services across various industries. I think it would easy for me to find a suitable job there.

Germany's work culture is known for work-life balance, and the programming community is very active and it submit lots contributes to the opensource world. As a programmer, I think work culture is crucial. I want to have time to learn and explore work-related knowledge and activities through public communities, as this would greatly benefit my future work capabilities. My currently work envinronment has high pressure, making it challenging to find a suitable job.

Therefore, I wish to go to Germany because the better living environment would enrich my life and allow me to explore my potential. The favorable work environment would enhance my professional skills and contribute to my working experience.



**What I can do and my qualifications:**

I have worked for three big corporation and two of them involve working with global colleagues. Therefore, I would quickly get into working Germany's international or local teams.

I have good working skills, which will be needed to German companies and can bring both of us returns. With my experience in the e-commerce and banking industries, I can handle the construction of project-based mainstream microservice software projects and successfully deal with high network traffic economically.

I have a quality education background, having obtained a Bachelor's degree in GIS from Tongji University, which is a good university in China. 

About the language, I am proficient in English, which is my working language and I have achieved 7 in IELTS. I am also planning to learn German.

My savings habits are also good, and I have enough savings to support my job search in Germany and enable me to start my life in the local community. Moreover, I don't have any debts.

Considering about above, they could help me to continue my career in Germany and I can contribute effectively to my employers.



**What I will do in Germany:**

Firstly, I will settle myself down and utilize my working skills to find a job.

Then, I will adapt to the local lifestyle and learn German by course or making friends, embracing a positive and diversity life. 

I plan to continue pursuing my interests in history and economics and explore the local culture.

I will also plan to find my life companion and build a family if I am lucky.

I believe that I can lead a fulfilling life in Germany, because I identify with the values of freedom, mutual assistance, and openness, which align with German society.
