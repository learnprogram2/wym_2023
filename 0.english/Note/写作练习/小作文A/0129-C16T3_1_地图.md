## 范文

**// introduction: 转述的很漂亮**

The diagrams **portray** what the Southwest airport looks like now **as well as** what the same place would be like a year later when the renovation works would be complete.

// overview: 

**// 主要写了2个, be expended, 和 more facilities**

Overall, the Southwest **airport will be expanded**, and it will offer far more facilities and better accessibility for passengers after the development work is done.

// Detail1: 

As the illustration suggests, the airport **now has a single arrival and departure area**. The departure area is on the left of the building and has a cafe, while the arrival area does not have such amenities. Straight ahead of the arrival area, customs and passport control could be seen. Similarly, passport control and security are located for departing passengers. The airport now has eight gates, two walkways, and check-in areas.

**After the development work**, which is expected to be done next year, the airport will have eighteen gates, and a sky train inside the airport. New shops will be built, and the departing passengers will have access to bag drop facilities. It will be built where the check-in point is now. Opposite it, there will be the check-in point. The renovated airport will have more departure and entry points to serve more passengers at a time. It will also have ATMs and cafes for passengers in the arrival area. Finally, a car hire facility would also be included on the right-side of the arrival hall.
