// introduction

The diagram shown above illustrate the procedure of electricity generation and it happens in a hydroelectric power station, which uses the power of water.

// overall

Overall, the circle process is comprised of five stages including maintain high-level reservoir, generate electricity at day time, transport power into national grid, pump low-level water at night and finaly transtport water to maintain high-level reservoir.

// detail1:

At the first stage, the dam helps collect water from river and create a high-level reservoir, which provide the source of the energy. Secondly, during daytime, the water flow through the pipe and gets into the turbines, which is the core of the power station and turns the generator on. Then, since the power station connect the local power line with the national grid, electricity transports into the whole country immediately after it was generated.

// detail2

At night, the reversible turbines will pump water because the low-level reservoir contains more walter during daytime. After the low-level water throught the turbines, it will be pumped through the pipe and the intake of the dam, which it flows down at daytime. Finally, the high-level reservoir get enough water again and the process begins again.

The diagram outlines the process of electricity production in a hydroelectric power station. The process begins when the water flows from the river into a high-level reservoir and ends with the transmission of electricity to the national grid.

In general, the process is broadly distributed into day and night stages with the daylight stages involving electricity production from a river and storage of water in a reservoir. At night, the water flows back in the opposite direction towards an initial reservoir and the river.

The day stage of the process involves channelling the river water into a high-level reservoir backed up by a dam. There is an intake area leading to the power station that opens during the day and closes at night. Water flows during the day to generate electricity through the power station turbines. The generated electricity is then sent to a national grid through power lines while the excess water runs to a low-level reservoir.

During the night stage, the water stored in the low-level reservoir is reverted to the power station and the turbines of the generator pump it back into the high-level reservoir which is closed during the night. The river water is stored at the upper level and later it flows down, starting the cycle again.
