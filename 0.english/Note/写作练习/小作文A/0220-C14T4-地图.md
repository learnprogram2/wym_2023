Also, there are several seat areas and rose gardens distributed along the outskirts of the central park. 

But things are quite different today, both the location and the facilities. Although two entrances are saved, an underground car park entrance is added to the right side of the park. One square rose garden is located in the center of the park and one rose garden is removed. The stage is replaced by an amphitheatre for concerts in the left part of the park and the glasshouse is substituted by a water feature. Besides, a new children's play area replaces the pond in the east-north of the park and the park introduces a cafe besides the play area and rearrange the location of all seats.

The maps outline the changes that took place in a public park called Grange Park from 1920 to today. 

Overall, the park was changed and renovated to offer people more possibilities than they used to have decades ago such as a cafe, theatre, playground and parking.

In details, the park was opened in 1920 and entertainment facilities including a larger stage and various areas for recreation have since been added to it. There was also notable relocation in terms of seats and the only areas that remained unchanged were the entrances and one minor garden. Besides, the fountain has been removed in favour of a rose garden with full seating arrangements around it. To the left of the new garden, the previous stage for musicians has been turned into a much larger amphitheatre facing the opposite direction that will allow for concerts in the park. This change has necessitated the removal of both seatings on the far left side as well as the rose garden in the bottom left corner of the map.

Moreover, the pond for water plants was removed from the right -top part of the garden and a children's play area was introduced in the right-top of the park, and near this area, a cafe was built. Instead of the pond, a water feature has been built occupying the bottom right corner. Interestingly, the number of rose gardens was reduced to two. Besides, an underground car park was built in the lower right corner of the park.

The maps illustrate the overall development of Grange park in Arnold avenue staged in two different periods - the first one depicts the park during its inauguration in 1920, and the latter portrays its present-day layout. 

Generally speaking, the overall layout of the park has been changed drastically except for the main entrances at Arnold avenue and Eldon Street. 

The park first opened in 1920, and it went through drastic developments since then. To begin with, the key feature of the park- the central fountain, has been demolished. The rose garden was earlier scattered around the periphery of the park along with the seating arrangements, but now it has been remobilised to the centre of the park. Meanwhile, the stage for the musicians has been further converted to an "Amphitheatre" for concerts to accommodate a larger crowd. However, the rose garden on the northwest has been retained. 

Besides, the glasshouse on the southeast side has been redesigned with a water feature and an underground entrance to the car park for visitors. The addition of amenities such as the cafe on the northeast side adjacent to Arnold avenue was also done. Finally, the pond of water plants was redesigned to accommodate a children’s play area.
