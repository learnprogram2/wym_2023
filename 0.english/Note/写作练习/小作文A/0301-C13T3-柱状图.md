// introduction

The bar chart shown above illustrate the electricity product and consume worldwide ranking top ten in 2014.

// overall,

Overall, The amount of electricity consumption and production are various in different countries and the consumption amount is equal to the production amount in one country generally.

// detail1 features

In the top ten countries, China and Unite States are the most highest countries and their electricity consumption and production are significantly higher than the others, which are 5398 billion kWh production and 5322 billion kWh consumption in China, 4099 billion kWh production 3866 billion kWh consumption in US. Russia is the third country, whose production is 1057 billion kWh and comsumption is 1038 billion kWh, then is Japan with 936 billion kWh in production and 856 billion kWh in consumption. the following countries are India, Canada, France, Brazil, Germany and finally Korea, Rep. Korea, Rep is the least and its' production and consumption are 485 billion and 449 billion kWh.

Although most countries electricity production surpass consumption slightly, Germany is the only country whose electricity production is 56 billion kWh shorter than consumption.

The bar chart gives information about top ten countries' electrical usage and supply in 2014.

It is clear that China was the largest production and consumption of electricity while Korea Republic was the least among all. All countries except Germany had their electrical energy production more than consumption in billion kWh.

From the chart, we can see that China took the leading role in electrical industry, with 5398 billion kWh production and 5322 billion kWh consumption. Ranking next was the Unites states, its energy supply and usage were around 1000 billion kWh less than China's, they were 4099 billion kWh and 3866 billion kWh, respectively. Russia was the third major electrical energy production and consumption country, however, both categories were about one in five when compared to China's.

Following the rank, the countries after Russia were Japan, India, Canada, France and Brazil, these countries' electricity supply production were all approximately 100 billion kWh more than their electricity usage. Interestingly, Germany, which positioned after Brazil, was the only country that its electricity consumption was 526.6 billion kWh, outweighed supply of electricity by 64.1 billion kWh. Finally, Korea Republic was the least active country in electrical industry, for its electrical supply and usage were 485.1 billion kWh and 449.5 billion kWh.

The given bar chart illustrates the amount of electricity produced and consumed, in kWh units, in the top ten countries - China, the US, Russia, Japan, India, Canada, France, Brazil, Germany, and Korea by the year 2014.

A glance at the chart reveals that China was generating and using the maximum amount of electricity while Korea was doing the opposite. Production of electricity was higher than consumption in all of the nations except Germany.

In terms of production, China was clearly ahead of all the other countries, producing 5398 billion kWh. As this number dropped slightly for the US, at 4099, it secured the second position for the US in the list. There was a dramatic reduction in the amount of generated electricity for Russia, Japan, and India which was 1057, 936, and 871 billion units respectively. While keeping similarity among them, the remaining countries produced electricity in the lowest quantity ranging from 485-618 billion units.

Regarding the consumption of current, a similar characteristic is shown by all the countries. China and the US was at the first and second position respectively in this category too by using 5322 and 3866 billion units of current. Meanwhile, the usage of electric goods were very low for other countries ranging from 449-1038 billion kWh. Despite generating different amounts of current in each nation, all of them were able to meet their needs except Germany which produced less energy in the form of electricity than it consumed.
