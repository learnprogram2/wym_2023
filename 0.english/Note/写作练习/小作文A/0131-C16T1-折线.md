As a general trend, 

```text
The first line graph outlines how the electrical appliance ownership in households in a country transformed during a century commencing from 1920 while the second chart delineates how it had affected the time spent on household work per week by the citizens in this country.

As a general trend, with the increasing number of electrical devices possessed by families, their need for doing housework significantly declined.

As the graph reveals, only 30 percent of households in this country used to have vacuum cleaners and four out of ten families had washing machines in 1920. Refrigerators were a rare electric appliance at that time.   Just after two decades, however, refrigerator possessions shoot up, and almost half of the families owned these three electric items in their homes. More families started to own such devices and at the beginning of the twenty-first century, almost all households had fridges and vacuum cleaners. The washing machine was owned by more than 70% of families which slowly but steadily increased till 2019. At that point, there was hardly any family without a refrigerator or vacuum cleaner.

It is interesting to note that, with the increasing number of electric appliances owned by families, their need for doing household work like preparing meals, cleaning and washing clothes remarkably diminished. While they used to work for 50 hours a week doing such work in 1920, it decreased to 20 hours in 1960 and 10 in 2019.
