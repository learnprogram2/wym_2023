It is a popular idea that students should pay for their own courses other than depend on the government to fund their higher education. I do not agree with this idea and believe that government should support a young man who has insufficient funds but wants to learn knowledge by taking education.

On the one hand, the government has the responsibility to develop everyone's strength at most, not just lucky dogs, because most people take social responsibilities so each of them should have the opportunity to develop himself/herself. A critical fact is that not everyone born with enough money to educate themselves, and they have to take more actions for living because society is not fair. If the government can help them get a good education, not only can they get a more joyful life but also our society will be more equal.

On the other hand, it is not a huge price to make this idea comes true. Firstly, most people just borrow money from government funds, and they will pay back with interests, so most funds are not just a waste of money. Secondly, they will improve the social wealthfare after they get a good education, because they will be more productive and creative. A harmonious community usually consists of people who own a good education, and that will be a win-win situation. 

For the reasons above, I think a good government should pay attention to helping those poor students who can not afford university education and that will make our society better.

Some people believe that everyone should have the opportunity to attend university without paying tuition fee but others disagree with this idea due to some reasons. I strongly disagree with the idea of free education in university. This essay will explain why university education should not be free to everyone.

 

 

University students pay some amount of tuition fee so that universities can improve the standard of the learning materials they use. Most institutions use these fees to obtain some equipment such as projectors and computers in order to enhance the learning experience of their students. For instance, in Sabanci University, Mechanical Engineering lectures are taught with CNC machines to enable students to understand better. So, tuition fee is crucial for universities to obtain ***\*state-of-the-art\**** equipment in order to provide quality education to their students.

 

On the other hand, some people believe that universities should be free to everyone because every student has the right to education regardless of their income. They argue that some people cannot get university education due to financial problems if it is not free. ***\*However, scholarships are the solution to this problem and some portion of tuition fees are used for other students who are not capable of paying for university.  This solution could prevent the inequality between students of different income levels.\**** ***\*在反对的观点里面给出处理办法\****

 

In conclusion, every people should have the chance to get a university education but students should pay a fee for this. This payment is crucial for schools to obtain equipment that are beneficial for learning. Also, these fees are used for other students as a scholarship in most of the universities.
