**Q:** In their advertising, businesses nowadays usually emphasize that their products are new in some way. 
Why is this? Do you think it is a positive or negative development? 



Businesses -> advertising / introduce / emphasize -> new product fashion

**Why:** 

**Positive / negative**



// introduction

In modern times, producer prefer to introduce the new features of their products and put them on the social medium more offen. I think this is a misguid trend and it will bring several disadvantages to both the customer and the producer.

// reasons: 

// more and more producers: compete with each other

// customer pay little attention to their needs

The main reason for this phenomenon is the intense competition between more and more producers. Producers have to show various special functions to attract customers and the new stuffs are more likely to become new fashion. Secondly, most customers pay little attention to what they needs or just because they  don't know how to compare different brands. For example, when we chose two soaps from different company, we can only refer to the advertisement and the introduction, so new features are the most attractive words. Therefore, producers usually emphasize that what they product is one of the most fashionest products.



// **negative:** 

// 1. custome can be misleaded by the merchant

// 2. Wasting a lot of resources 

This fashion prefer trend can bring various dissadvantages to our society. First, customers are more likely to be cheat by misleading advertisements and they forget their truly needs when making decisions. For example plenty of elder people are persuaded to buy some useless healthy medicines and it may be even harmful to them. Second, the society are losing plenty resources when producers only focus on the fashion style. For example, people accept the thought that they have to purchase new clothes every year, but some poor people have to relay on donation to get something to wair. So, when we listen to the advertisement we would get some disadvantages now and then.



In conclusion, New products become popular not only because of the prodcuers but also the customers, but we need to realize it will bring us various disadvantages.

With  concurrent technologies, adverts are accompanied by a cyber link. society can see advertisements everywhere. And loads of them are trying to deliver the messages that they are the latest. There are several reasons why they want to tell people that they are new. Also, I think that the cons might be more than pons.

Firstly, since those new inventions claim that they are the first in their fields, others cannot mimic or even use them. For example, when the Apple company clarify that the apple is its products’ logo, nobody can utilize it anymore. Another reason why businesses emphasise this is that the folk may want to try their creativity. Research has been found that the folk tend to buy novelty things or something they have never touched before. Additionally, those marketing planners may exercise these selling methods to achieve their goals and increase  sales.

However, too many adverts saying they are the newest may also bring some negative impactions. First, since they are expanding their fames, they definitely exhibit a lot in various ways such as on the net platforms or on the buses. Originally, society may still watch these videos or ads. When  time passes by, society may become annoyed or bothered and eventually may not want to see or even ignore them. What’s more, the public may not want to be the first user. In nowadays’ world, there is an army of reviews or recommendations on the internet. Before those consumers buy, they obviously search for them. As a result, this may lessen the selling numbers. 

To conclude, I consider that the sunny sides are more than the dark sides in emphasizing they are renovating. Yet, it also has its downsides in particular situations.
