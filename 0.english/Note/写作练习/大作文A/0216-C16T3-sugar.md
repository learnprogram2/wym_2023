Many manufactured **food and drink products** contain **high levels of sugar**; which causes many health problems. Sugary products should be made more expensive to encourage people to consume less sugar.  
Do you agree or disagree?  



Manufactured food / drink products -> high sugar  -> health problems 

Sugar product should more expensive ?

Artificial food 





*In the future all cars,buses and trucks will be driverless. The only people traveling inside these vehicles will be passengers.* 



*Do you think the advantages of driverless vehicles outweigh the disadvantages?* 



technology Driveless -> people will be passengers

Advantages vs disadvantages

// agree 



// introduction

Since more and more people are concerned about artificial intelligent, we believe that driverless vehicles idea will be came true in the future, so we don't need to drive ourselves. There is a discussion about if the benefits from driverless cars overcome the disadvantages and I think the advantages are over disadvantages.

// detail1: benefits

// car sharing

// free time

To begin with, driveless technology can bring us plenty of benefits. Firstly, we will save more time rather than waste every day's transportation time, because self-driven car will bring us directly to the office and we can save lots of energy too. Secondly, car sharing market will be more prosperous, so we even don't need to purchase a car any more. For example, booking a car will be a habbit to us for what ever we get out because more car will be avaluable on the street. Therefore, driveless vehicles will make our life more convinient.

// detail2: more choice 



In addition, driveless technology is just an optional choice for us and we can still drive by ourself, so it will be tiny affect to those who love driving. If we are tired, we can let the artificial intelligent drive, but we can still enjoy the fun of driving when we are traveling. What is more, since we don't need so many cars we have now, there will be fewer congestion and fewer fuel consumption, so we can predict that the environment will be cleaner. Thus driveless cars can benefit us in various ways and we should accept it.



In conclusion, driveless cars directly cut down our transportation time and it can also benefit us a lovely environment and work-life balance habbit.

Due to the development of technology,  in the ,future there will be driverless vehicles such as cars, buses, trucks or public transport. I personally believe that automated vehicles will bring more benefits in participating in traffic than the limitations.

First of all, self-driving automation help people decrease traffic accidents because some people do not obey traffic laws. In addition, businesses would not need to hire drivers to deliver their products to their customers and ensure the safety of passengers when using autopilot car services. Besides, it is suitable for older and disabled travellers when using to move somewhere and react quickly when there is an obstacle ahead or something suddenly passed by like animals or careless pedestrians. For instance, if you use a vehicle with an automated driver, you can spend more time doing other work during sitting in the car. 

Meanwhile, we still have several disadvantages such as the number of drivers will be disappeared and resulting in an increase in unemployment in the future. Another issue is that automated vehicles would require high costs in repairs or annual maintenance which would be annoying and expensive as well. For example, it would be the long term of the process which waste time and money to the companies have removed all old moto driver instead of driverless cars go with training is quite cost an arm and a leg. However, problems will be solved if the government has the proper policy for the people and automation may help to reduce significantly the rate of accidents.

In conclusion, as far as I am concerned, I am in favour of the opinion that automated vehicles will have more benefits than drawbacks. Furthermore, many companies and researchers have produced driverless cars to serve the demand of residents in recent years.
