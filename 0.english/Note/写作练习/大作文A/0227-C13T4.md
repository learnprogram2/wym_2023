Moreover, the disability of the market is partly because of the heavy taxes and violence from the powerful government. For example, a large group of army consume plenty of resources from one country and it stops people selling or buying things from foreigners.  Therefore, the reasons why people can not feed themselves are complicated.

To solve this problem, we still have several efforts to make. Firstly, our society should publish more regular and standard laws, so everyone's rights and properties can be protected. For instance, small stores don't have to pay the majority of their incomes to the government as tax.

With passing times, new technological advancements in agriculture emerge and are being implemented. However, despite these advancements, many people throughout the world continue to suffer from hunger and famine. In the following lines, I shall discuss the causes of food scarcity and possible solutions for such issues. 

Several variables contribute to the global condition of hunger. Despite agricultural advancements, the problem of food storage is becoming more prevalent in many nations. Low-income families often go hungry and run out of money, and because of that, they rely on a limited amount of food. Moreover, small-scale farmers lack appropriate storage facilities for their supplies, causing pests and adverse weather conditions to harm their crops. Additionally, growing overpopulation is another factor that has contributed to food scarcity. As the world’s population grows every day, there aren’t enough crops cultivated to feed them. Another factor that has contributed to food scarcity or famine is food waste. Many well-developed enterprises, such as restaurants, prepare food in large quantities. People, on the other hand, do not eat all of it. As a result, any remaining food is discarded in garbage cans.

In order to avoid wasting food or decrease hunger and starvation amongst people all over the world, people should take proper measures, and avoid food hoarding. Many have a habit of buying more food than needed. Instead, individuals should purchase the necessary food and preserve it for later use. Furthermore, individuals should store their food properly. Fruits and vegetables that are stored incorrectly decay rapidly. Establishments like restaurants should make it a routine to give away surplus meals to those in need. Besides that, governments should provide storage facilities to small-scale farmers so that no harvests are lost, and food supply imbalances are effectively addressed. Apart from that, the government should impose strict regulations to control the growth of population.

To summarise, people starve because of poor food storage and usage. However, appropriate steps, such as financial assistance, can help prevent food waste and ensure it reaches those who need it most.

The scarcity of food from mine is a very obvious situation all around the globe. Apart from modern society, so much advancement, and an agricultural breakthrough has incremented the yield of food and crops. Despite the vast section involved in agricultural development, a large amount of the population is suffering from malnutrition. This essay determines the causes and the remedies that can be considered.

The first reason for this for mine or the scarcity of food conditions is the irregular production of food due to and disturbing uneven distribution of resources. For instance, in India, the cultivation of food or crops is limited in mountain or desert areas due to unproductive land and climatic conditions. Whereas the plain land has more cultivated crops. Hence the people living in the hilly area get fewer options whereas the flatland people have numerous options. Secondly, De storage facility, transportation, and inflation is causing these situations. Influential people do not face any difficulty with food. The poverty-stricken people are the most effective class. The farmers have to overcome various circumstances like natural Calamities, pace controls, and an appropriate storage system, which hampers the production of a large amount.

On the other hand, overpopulation is also a big problem for the Maa situation. The rate of increasing population is not proportional to the rate of the amount of food produced in any area. Due to this inverse proportional situation, the hunger rate in different areas or countries is increasing. The future generation must not be deprived of food. Government must take necessary steps to control the population. And as symmetrical distribution of natural resources can help people survive the food problem, making the public aware of the usage and abuses of various things such as facilities, technologies, and scientific methods can help farmers grow more crops. Also, the government must help the local farmers with gross price increases. The wastage of food must be stopped and restaurants must provide surplus food to needy people. The government and non-government organizations must work together and create jobs to cater food to people suffering from malnutrition.

Lastly, even after the advancement in agricultural technologies, a large section of the population is still suffering. So it is high time that every individual must take care that no food must be wasted and the needy people must get food and other facilities.

In recent years, the globe has been dominated by new technology and innovation. Additionally, improvements to the way agriculture is perceived are being made. Despite this development in technology, starvation and hunger still affect a large number of people worldwide. The reason for food scarcity and potential solutions will both be covered in this essay.

First off, a number of factors play a role in the current state of world hunger. Despite improvements in agriculture and technology, the food storage system is spreading throughout many countries. However, low-income families frequently run out of money or go without food because they can only afford a very limited supply of food.
