- my opinion:
- Discuss both views



// introduction

Some people holding this view that history is the crucial major in school, while others aggree that science and technology are more vital than history in modern times. I agree with the second opinion because science and technology contribute to our society.

// detail1: science technology help our society:

// 1. better live quality, so many poor people are waiting to welfare, charity

// 2. Meaningful life, make history

To begin with, science and technology do plenty of help to our life. Firstly, they improve our living quality a lot because most modern equipment based on science and they enhance our production and consumption produce significantly. For example, developed country which owns more resources than developing country and they even distribute extra food and clothes to poor people as charity.

// no conflict: history can lead to 

On the other hand, regard history as a serious major can also lead several issues. First, most innovations come from breaking the chains of the restriction of the history and we will loss the creativity if we just follow the rule. For instance, mobile cars were criticized for reduce horse owners' opportunities, so we should view history as a objective subject. What's more, science and technology are specific histories too, especially when we need experience from the history. Thus, technology and science have no conflict with history and we should break restriction rules from the history.

In conclusion, technology and science benefit us in various ways, while history can bring several disadvantages, so I think we should focus more attention on science and technology other than history.
