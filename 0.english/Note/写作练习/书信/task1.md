===== 



I am agree with the suggestion about teenagers speed time on work as well as study. 

When I was young at highschool, I spend a lot of time on studying academic subjects. But I don't know how to earn money for my family, which is my skilled work. So I think when teenagers have to choose their carrier with no working experiense, they may made mistakes.

When we talking about some skilled jobs, like farmers, repairers. They don't need too much academic study, but they need a lots of practise. If they don't do it when teenage, they may lose the best time to practise.

I also don't think all the teenagers should spend a lot time on work. Many students don't have a target job, so they just need to experience some jobs, and have a good time on their school days.

On the other hand, I think teenagers can follow some their parents advices other than school's. Their parents are more love and know more about their children, so they may have a suitable suggestion.

We people came to this world with a lot of unknown secrets, so both acatemic study and working are subjects we all should take. Don't judge them by what they looks. If a student doing one job more than 10 years which is study, we cann't tell it's a good thing for themselives.

I hope more student have a chance to experience more than study, they will have a better understand of this world, and know a better way to associate with eachothers. Hope they have a good life.
