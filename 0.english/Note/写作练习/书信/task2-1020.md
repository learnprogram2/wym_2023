Introduction:

I agree with the idea that the advantages of taking risks outweight the disadvantages though it depends on the specific background. All great creations are started by taking risks, and lots of regretful fails also from taking risks.

Taking risks has lots of good results to human society. The first is family, to reduce the unpredictable risk around us during our life, we opt to get married and have children, there for we can experience more joyful emotions. The second is better ecomonic, most companies created not only because of the aim for effictive production, but also because of collabrate to defence risks. The third good result is the good community we live in. When the society consists of more and more families and companies, most of the people are partners, so we need to build our community which contains hospital, schools and governments.

Taking risks also results something bad since the future is unpredictable, and our decisions can also be wrong. Taking risks usually means we are going into an unknow environment, so individuals can get hurt or lose money, and families can get devorced. Although companies are came about reduce risks, but when they can not satisfied customers' needs, they have to break down. When the majory of people in our community get creazy about some ideas that not right, we have to live up with a lower living quality.

The disadvantages are alway there waiting for us, unless we take the responsibility of ourselves and get together to take the risks, and the advantages will be waiting for us.

The bad results from taking risks always have a big impression on us, but the long-term influence is not that large. For example, We may get hurt from taking risks, especially when we are doing some outdoor exercises, and most of the damage can get cured and settled down by time. In our career, we usually take risks for chances, like hosting a new project. We may be downgraded or even get fired if the project is not running well, but the experiences we got can put us in another occupation quickly. So we usually have our view of the important overshadowed by the disadvantages, which can be resolved over time mostly.
